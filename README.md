# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the original student data file shows evidence of acedemic dishonesty for the ninth grade students at Thomas High School. To uphold state-testing standards, we are replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School 9th-graders with NaN while keeping the rest of hte data intact. The school district analysis will be run again with the modified data.

## Results
- After removing the test schores for the ninth grade students at Thomas High, the Average Math Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing all went down by less than half a percent.
